First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files. 

Then I used the same command in the inhere directory.

The -a represents all, -l represents list, essentially meaning to show all contents of the directory in a list format.

Catting the ...Hiding-From-You file reveals the password. We then SSH to Level 4.
