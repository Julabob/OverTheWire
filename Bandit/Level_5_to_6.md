First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files. 

We then navigate into the inhere directory.


```bash 
cd inhere
ls
```
That lists all the files in the inhere directory.

We see several directories. 
```bash 
man find | grep "\-size"
find -size 1033c
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
```
The first line is used to search for any instances of *size* in the manual page of the *find* command. 

I then used the *find* command with the specified bytes. This led to one file being shown.

I then used the cat command to view the file which gave me the answer.

When prompted for the password, we type HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG. We can proceed to level 5.
