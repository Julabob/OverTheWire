First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files. 

We then navigate into the inhere directory.


```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files in the inhere directory.

I then used the cat command to view each file until I got the human-readable file.

When prompted for the password, we type HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG. We can proceed to level 6.
