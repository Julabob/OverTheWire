First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files.

What I did then was type cat, then type a few characters of the file name. I typed *spa* and then clicked on *Tab*. Clicking on Tab will autofill the command. This is the way I solved this challenge.

```bash
cat spa (then clicked Tab)
```

The other way is to use *\\* in front of the spaces in the file name while typing the command.

Catting (:D) the command will reveal the password.

We then proceed to Level 3.
