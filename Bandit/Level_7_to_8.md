First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls
```
That lists all the files. 

I then catted the file with grep to identify the word *millionth* as given in the webiste. This gives us the password for the next level. When prompted for the password, we type dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc. We can proceed to level 8.
