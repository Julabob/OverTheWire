First, we look at the directory's contents using the ls command.

```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files. 

We then navigate into to the inhere directory.


```bash 
ls -al
```
That lists all the files in the inhere directory.

I then used the cat command to view each file until I got the human readable file.
